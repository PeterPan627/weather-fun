# weather-fun
An example project for the revision control training course


The aim of this project is to get a hands-on experience with classifying weather data to accurately represent the weather conditions in Cambridge.

The data has to be downloaded from the Computer Lab's website (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/weather-raw.csv)
